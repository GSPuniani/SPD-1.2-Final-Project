# SPD-1.2-Final-Project

<i>Make School SPD 1.2: Final UI/UX Project</i>

This project is a prototype for a service to aid browsing and searching on Netflix. This website was made with the Bootstrap framework. Future iterations of this project would probably incorporate an API such as uNOGS (unofficial Netflix Online Global Search). For this current iteration, mock data was used.
